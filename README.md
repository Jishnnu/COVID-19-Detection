This repository contains all the materials related to the implementation of a **_Hybrid Machine Learning model to predict if an individual has contracted COVID-19 from the symptoms they experience_**. 

Please make sure that you change the existing path specification with your custom directory path in the source code. I have deployed this CNN model on Gradio. Simply click on the **_Open in Gradio_** button to check it out.
