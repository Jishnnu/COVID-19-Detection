This repository contains all the materials related to the implementation of a **_Hybrid Machine Learning model to predict if an individual has contracted COVID-19 from the symptoms they experience and from the X-Ray scans of their chest (lungs)_**. 

Please make sure that you change the existing path specification with your custom directory path in the source code. I have deployed this Hybrid Machine Learning model on HuggingFace as a **_Gradio Application_**. Simply click on the **_Open in HF Spaces_** button to check it out.
